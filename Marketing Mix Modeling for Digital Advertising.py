# # Project Brief: Marketing Mix Modeling for Digital Advertising  
# **Author:** Olaoluwa J. Taiwo  
# 
# ## Title  
# Evaluating the Impact of Digital Marketing Channels on Sales Performance: A Marketing Mix Modeling Approach  
# 
# ## Background  
# In today’s competitive business environment, understanding how different marketing channels contribute to sales is essential for optimising advertising budgets. Marketing Mix Modeling (MMM) provides a quantitative framework to assess the effectiveness of various channels by linking marketing spend to sales outcomes.  
# 
# The provided dataset spans 200 weeks, containing information on advertising investments across three digital channels **TikTok, Facebook, and Google Ads** along with corresponding **sales figures**.  
# 
# ## Aim  
# To develop a Marketing Mix Model that quantifies the contribution of TikTok, Facebook, and Google Ads to sales, thereby guiding data-driven budget allocation decisions.  
# 
# ## Objectives  
# 1. **Data Exploration & Cleaning**  
#    - Understand the structure and trends of marketing spend and sales.  
#    - Ensure data consistency and prepare variables for modeling.  
# 
# 2. **Channel Contribution Analysis**  
#    - Estimate the relative impact of TikTok, Facebook, and Google Ads on sales.  
#    - Identify diminishing returns or saturation effects.  
# 
# 3. **Model Development**  
#    - Build a regression-based MMM to quantify channel elasticity.  
#    - Validate the model using statistical tests and predictive accuracy.  
# 
# 4. **Optimization & Scenario Planning**  
#    - Simulate budget reallocation scenarios to maximize sales.  
#    - Provide actionable recommendations on optimal spend distribution across channels.  
# 
# 5. **Insights & Recommendations**  
#    - Summarize key findings on which channels drive the highest ROI.  
#    - Offer strategic guidance for future marketing investments.

# Sales data (2018–2021) show strong variability influenced by digital ad spend. TikTok spend is highly volatile with large peaks, while Facebook and Google Ads are more stable. Sales average 10.7K, ranging from 4.5K–17.6K. Higher ad investments, particularly in TikTok and Google Ads, correlate with stronger sales performance.

plt.show()


# The boxplot shows significant variation across ad platforms. TikTok spend is highly skewed with large fluctuations, while Facebook spend is moderate but also variable. Google Ads spend is more stable with fewer outliers. Sales display a wide range, suggesting ad spend volatility especially TikTok closely influences sales performance and peaks.

# The correlation heatmap shows TikTok spend has the strongest positive relationship with sales (0.68), followed by Facebook (0.47) and Google Ads (0.36). TikTok stands out as the most influential channel. Weak or negative correlations between ad platforms suggest they act independently rather than substituting one another in driving sales.

# The pairplot shows clear positive relationships between ad spend and sales, with TikTok displaying the strongest upward trend, followed by Facebook and Google Ads. Distributions reveal that TikTok and Facebook spends are often zero but produce high sales when invested. This confirms digital ad campaigns significantly boost sales outcomes.

# # 3. Feature Engineering

# In[97]:


# 1. Adstock Transformation

# let apply adstock because advertising has a "carryover effect" —
# meaning the impact of spend this week may influence sales in future weeks.
def adstock(series, alpha=0.5):
    """Apply adstock transformation with decay factor alpha."""
    result = []
    prev = 0
    for x in series:
        val = x + alpha * prev
        result.append(val)
        prev = val
    return np.array(result)

data["TikTok_adstock"] = adstock(data["TikTok"], alpha=0.5)
data["Facebook_adstock"] = adstock(data["Facebook"], alpha=0.5)
data["GoogleAds_adstock"] = adstock(data["Google Ads"], alpha=0.5)
data.head()


# In this step, I applied the Adstock transformation to TikTok, Facebook, and Google Ads spend. Advertising does not influence sales only in the week it is shown; its impact carries over into future weeks as customers recall or act on campaigns later. The Adstock model captures this carryover effect by allowing part of the previous week’s impact to persist, controlled by a decay factor (α = 0.5 here, meaning 50% of last week’s effect remains). This creates more realistic features for modeling, improves forecast accuracy, and better reflects how marketing spend truly drives sales over time.

# In[98]:


# 2. Log Transformation
# ---------------------
# I take the log of spends and sales to capture "diminishing returns".
# In reality, doubling spend does not always double sales — the effect is concave.
for col in ["TikTok", "Facebook", "Google Ads", "Sales"]:
    data[col + "_log"] = np.log1p(data[col])  # log(1+x) avoids issues with zero values
data.head()


# In this step, I applied a log transformation to TikTok, Facebook, Google Ads, and Sales. Marketing spend often shows diminishing returns: doubling spend rarely doubles sales, as the response curve is concave. A log scale helps capture this reality by compressing large values and highlighting relative rather than absolute changes. Using log(1+x) ensures we can handle zero values without errors. This transformation makes relationships between ad spend and sales more linear, stabilizes variance, and improves model interpretability. Ultimately, it aligns the data with economic intuition, leading to more accurate and realistic forecasting results.

# In[99]:


# 4. Moving Averages
# ------------------
# I calculate moving averages to smooth out short-term noise.
# This helps reveal medium-term trends in spend and sales.
window = 4  # ~1 month if weekly data
for col in ["TikTok", "Facebook", "Google Ads", "Sales"]:
    data[col + "_MA"] = data[col].rolling(window=window).mean()
    
data.head()


# To smooth short-term fluctuations, I computed moving averages (MA) for TikTok, Facebook, Google Ads, and Sales using a 4-week rolling window (about one month). Marketing and sales data often contain weekly noise caused by small campaign shifts, seasonality, or outliers. By averaging across consecutive weeks, moving averages highlight the underlying medium-term trends and make patterns more visible. This helps reduce volatility, stabilize the input features, and improve model robustness. Including moving averages in the dataset allows the forecasting model to capture both immediate effects and broader trends, leading to more reliable insights for sales prediction and budget planning.

# In[100]:


# 5. Seasonality Features
# -----------------------
# I create calendar-based features because marketing and sales often follow seasonal patterns
# (e.g., Q4 holiday spending boosts sales, January dips).
data["month"] = data.index.month
data["quarter"] = data.index.quarter
data["year"] = data.index.year
data.head()


# In[101]:


# I also encode months cyclically (using sine/cosine) so that December and January are close together.
data["month_sin"] = np.sin(2 * np.pi * data.index.month / 12)
data["month_cos"] = np.cos(2 * np.pi * data.index.month / 12)


# In[102]:


# 6. Spend Shares
# I compute spend shares to understand the relative importance of each channel
# compared to the total marketing budget in a given week.
data["total_spend"] = data["TikTok"] + data["Facebook"] + data["Google Ads"]

for col in ["TikTok", "Facebook", "Google Ads"]:
    data[col + "_share"] = data[col] / data["total_spend"].replace(0, np.nan)

# First, I create the lag and rolling average features
data["Sales_lag_1"] = data["Sales"].shift(1)   # 1-week lag
data["Sales_roll_mean_3w"] = data["Sales"].rolling(window=3).mean()  # 3-week rolling average

# Now I plot actual sales, lagged sales, and rolling mean
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 4))
plt.plot(data.index, data["Sales"], label="Actual Sales", linewidth=2)
plt.plot(data.index, data["Sales_lag_1"], label="Sales Lag 1", linestyle="--")

plt.legend()
plt.xlabel("Date")
plt.ylabel("Sales")
plt.title("Sales, Lagged Sales, and 3-Week Rolling Average")
plt.show()


# This chart compares actual sales, lagged sales (1-week shift), and a 3-week rolling average. Lagged sales features help capture autocorrelation, reflecting that sales in one week are often related to sales in the previous week. Meanwhile, the rolling average smooths out weekly volatility and highlights medium-term demand patterns. Together, these engineered features enrich the dataset by providing both short-term momentum (lag) and trend stability (rolling mean). This combination allows forecasting models to better capture seasonality, repeated cycles, and noise-free trends, ultimately improving prediction accuracy and supporting more reliable business planning.

# # 4. Modelling Stage: Marketing Mix Modelling (MMM)
# 
# I will now train and compare five different models:
# 1. **Baseline:** Multiple Linear Regression  
# 2. **Regularised:** Ridge & Lasso  
# 3. **Industry Standard:** Adstock + Log-Linear Regression  
# 4. **Time Series:** SARIMAX (sales with ad spends as regressors)  
# 5. **Machine Learning Benchmark:** Random Forest Regressor  
# 
# I will evaluate them using:
# - **R²** (fit quality)  
# - **RMSE** (error magnitude)  
# - **MAPE** (scale-free percentage error)  
# - **Actual vs Predicted Plots**

# # Model Comparison Insights
# 
# From the scatterplots of **Actual vs Predicted Sales**:
# 
# ## 1. Linear Regression
# - Predictions align closely with the diagonal line.  
# - Consistent performance, but may be slightly sensitive to multicollinearity.  
# - Good as a **baseline benchmark**.  
# 
# ## 2. Ridge Regression
# - Very similar to Linear Regression, but slightly more stable.  
# - Handles correlation between channels better.  
# - Strong candidate for **balanced interpretability and robustness**.  
# 
# ## 3. Lasso Regression
# - Predictions also align well, though with a bit more spread than Ridge.  
# - Performs feature selection by shrinking weaker coefficients.  
# - Useful if we want to simplify the model by keeping only the strongest drivers.  
# 
# ## 4. SARIMAX
# - Predictions show more scatter around the diagonal.  
# - Captures some time-series effects, but **less accurate than regression-based models** in this dataset.  
# - May improve if we include more seasonal/external factors (e.g., holidays, trends).  
# 
# ## 5. Random Forest
# - Predictions show higher variance compared to regression models.  
# - Captures non-linearities but may be **overfitting** due to small dataset size.  
# - Less interpretable than regression, weaker fit here.  
# 
# ---
# 
# # Overall Conclusion
# - **Best Performing Models:** Linear Regression and Ridge Regression (good balance of fit and interpretability).  
# - **Industry Standard:** Adstock + Log-Linear Regression still provides valuable **elasticities** for ROI analysis.  
# - **Weaker Models:** SARIMAX and Random Forest underperform with current features.  
# - For decision-making and budget optimisation, I would recommend **Ridge Regression + Log-Linear MMM** as the main models to trust.
# 

# # Post-Prediction Analysis
# 
# After comparing model performance, I now perform **post-prediction analysis** to evaluate accuracy, stability, and business insights.

# The residuals plot shows how prediction errors fluctuate around zero. Ideally, residuals should appear random without systematic trends. In this case, the Ridge model captures much of the sales variation, but some residual spikes persist, suggesting occasional under- and over-predictions, possibly during demand peaks. The histogram indicates that residuals are roughly centred around zero but slightly skewed, meaning predictions are not perfectly unbiased. The distribution is reasonably normal, though with a few large deviations. This suggests the model is well-calibrated overall but could be improved by incorporating additional seasonal or external demand drivers.

# This plot compares actual sales with Ridge model predictions over time. The predicted line (dashed) closely follows the actual line (solid), showing the model successfully captures sales dynamics. Peaks and troughs align fairly well, though some high peaks are slightly underestimated and some low dips are overestimated, indicating minor smoothing. Overall, the Ridge model generalises strongly with consistent predictive ability. This demonstrates that it balances accuracy with interpretability, making it a reliable candidate for marketing mix modelling. Additional refinements such as seasonality adjustments could help improve performance during volatile sales periods.

# # Final Recommendation: Model Selection & Budget Allocation
# 
# ## Model Selection
# After evaluating multiple models on **R², RMSE, and MAPE**, the results show:
# 
# - **Ridge Regression** performs best:
#   - **R² = 0.941** (highest accuracy)
#   - **RMSE = 570** (lowest error)
#   - **MAPE = 4.27%** (most reliable forecast error)
# - Ridge also reduces overfitting risk compared to plain Linear Regression.
